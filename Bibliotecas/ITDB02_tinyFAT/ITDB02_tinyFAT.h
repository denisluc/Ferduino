/*
  ITDB02_tinyFAT.h - Add-on library to integrate ITDB02_Graph and tinyFAT
  Copyright (C)2010-2011 Henning Karlsen. All right reserved
  
  Basic functionality of this library are based on the demo-code provided by
  ITead studio. You can find the latest version of the library at
  http://www.henningkarlsen.com/electronics

  This library has been made especially for the 2.4" TFT LCD Screen Module: 
  ITDB02-2.4(D) by ITead studio. This library has been designed to use 8bit mode, 
  so it will not work with the 3.2" Module.

  If you make any modifications or improvements to the code, I would appreciate
  that you share the code with me so that I might include it in the next release.
  I can be contacted through http://www.henningkarlsen.com/electronics/contact.php
